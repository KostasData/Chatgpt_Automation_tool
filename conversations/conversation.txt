Below is an example of a simplified database schema for an online store:
sql
Copy code
-- Table to store information about customers
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    phone_number VARCHAR(20),
    address VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Table to store information about products
CREATE TABLE Products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    description TEXT,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    stock_quantity INT
);

-- Table to store information about orders
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
);

-- Table to store information about ordered items
CREATE TABLE OrderItems (
    order_item_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    order_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    subtotal DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES Orders(order_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES Products(product_id)
);
This schema consists of four tables:
Customers: Stores information about customers such as their name, email, phone number, and address.
Products: Stores information about products available in the store such as name, description, price, and stock quantity.
Orders: Stores information about orders placed by customers. It includes the customer ID, order date, and total amount.
OrderItems: Stores information about items included in each order. It includes the order ID, product ID, quantity, and subtotal.
This schema allows for tracking customers, products, orders, and items ordered in a relational manner.
